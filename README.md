### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I am a programmer with a focus on company information systems. I have experience working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including SQL, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Node.js, Flutter, and Svelte.

My current projects include a hospital management system, inventory management system, accounting system, and academic system. I am also constantly learning and expanding my skillset, with a focus on data science and technologies such as Redis and Pandas.

While I am unable to share specific details about my production projects on public platforms such as GitHub, I am proud to have worked on a number of systems that have been in use for over 5 years. These projects have provided me with valuable experience in developing reliable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and experiences to help organizations and businesses succeed. If you have a project that you think I might be able to help with, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I am confident in my ability to deliver high-quality results, and I am always open to discussing potential collaboration opportunities.

In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date on the latest programming trends and contributing to open source projects.

Thank you for visiting my profile. I hope you find my projects and contributions interesting and useful. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
