### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I am a programmer with a focus on company information systems. I have experience working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including SQL, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Node.js, Flutter, and Svelte.

My current projects include a hospital management system, inventory management system, accounting system, and academic system. I am also constantly learning and expanding my skillset, with a focus on data science and technologies such as Redis and Pandas.

In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date on the latest programming trends and contributing to open source projects.
